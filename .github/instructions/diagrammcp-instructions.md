An MCP server using FastMCP python library.
A conceptual NLP component that uses the Azure OpenAI API to understand the text and convert it into a structured JSON format. 
The prompt used in NLP component should guide LLM to:
The prompt must guide the LLM to:

Identify Azure services, their names, and relevant attributes.
Recognize relationships between these services.
Understand grouping or clustering (e.g., resources within a resource group or subnet).
Output the extracted information in a predefined structured JSON format.
The JSON format should include:
{
  "diagram_label": "My Web App Architecture",
  "resources":,
  "relationships":,
  "clusters":
    }
  ]
}
example JSON output:
{
    "diagram_label": "My Web App Architecture",
    "resources": [
        {
        "name": "Web App",
        "type": "Azure.WebApp",
        "attributes": {
            "location": "East US",
            "sku": "S1"
        }
        },
        {
        "name": "SQL Database",
        "type": "Azure.SQLDatabase",
        "attributes": {
            "location": "East US",
            "sku": "S2"
        }
        }
  "resources": [
    {
      "name": "Web App",
      "type": "Azure.WebApp",
      "attributes": {
        "location": "East US",
        "sku": "S1"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "SQL Database",
      "type": "Azure.SQLDatabase",
      "attributes": {
        "location": "East US",
        "sku": "S2"
      }
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "source": "Web App",
      "target": "SQL Database",
      "type": "connects_to"
    }
  ],
  "clusters": [
    {
      "name": "Resource Group 1",
      "resources": ["Web App", "SQL Database"]
    }
  ]
}
A diagramming engine that takes this JSON, maps it to diagrams library components, and generates an image. The diagram should be created based on following features:
- generate_diagram_from_json takes the structured JSON from the NLP step.
- It uses the AZURE_NODE_MAP to find the corresponding diagrams library (rsaz-diagrams) class for each resource type.
- It creates nodes, clusters (if specified in the JSON), and relationships (edges) between them.
- It attempts to render the diagram directly to bytes using the graphviz Python library. If this library isn't installed, it falls back to letting diagrams save to a temporary file, then reads and deletes that file.
- CRITICAL DEPENDENCY: The diagrams library relies on Graphviz being installed on the system where this server runs. This is not a Python library but a separate software package. Ensure it's installed and its bin directory is in your system's PATH.
- Each resource should be represented as a node in the diagram.
- Relationships should be represented as edges connecting the nodes.
- Clusters should be represented as groups of nodes, with a label indicating the cluster name.
- The diagram should be visually appealing, with appropriate spacing and alignment.
- The diagram should be exportable in common formats (e.g., PNG, SVG).
- The diagram should be responsive to different screen sizes.
- The diagram should be interactive, allowing users to hover over nodes for more information.
- The diagram should support zooming and panning.

The MCP tool (generate_azure_diagram_from_text) will expose this functionality, taking text input and returning a diagram image with the following features:
- This is deployed as Azure Function App exposed by the MCP server.
- It takes the architecture_description (string), output_format (string, e.g., "png", "svg", default "png"), and layout_direction (string, e.g., "TB", "LR", default "TB").
- It orchestrates the call to the NLP engine and then the diagramming engine.
- It returns an mcp.server.fastmcp.Image object containing the diagram image bytes and format.

Running the Server:
- Save the code as a Python file (e.g., azure_diagram_server.py).
- Install necessary Python libraries:
```bash
pip install "mcp[server]" diagrams requests graphviz
```
(Note: graphviz here is the Python client library; the Graphviz software itself needs separate installation).
Run the server from your terminal:
```bash
python azure_diagram_server.py
```
The server will then be available for MCP clients to connect to and use the generate_azure_diagram_from_text tool.

Create MCP Client
- The MCP client will be simple webpage which will take the text input from user and call the MCP server to generate the diagram.
- The client will use JavaScript to make an HTTP POST request to the server with the text input.
- The client will display the returned diagram image on the webpage.
- The client will also allow the user to specify the output format and layout direction.
- The client will handle errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user if the diagram generation fails.
- The client will be responsive and work on different screen sizes.
- The client will be styled using CSS to ensure a good user experience.
- The client will be deployed as a static website on Azure Blob Storage or similar service.
